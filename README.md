This project is related with 3D graphics api such as DirectX. Researching and developing physically based rendering via **C++, HLSL**. 

To-do

 - [x] Primitive Rendering (No graphical features such as lighting, post processing)
	 - [x] Sphere rendering
	 - [x] Quad rendering
 - [x] Basic Rendering
	 - [x] Lighting (Based on Phong)
	 - [x] Post processing (Screen quad)
 - [ ] Adavanced Rendering (Include PBR)
	 - [ ] Microfacet model
	 - [ ] More post processing (Color Aberration)
	 - [ ] Shader effects (Fresnel, Bloom & Emissive)
	 - [ ] Vertex displacement (Include parallax occlusion mapping)

The owner of the project is a student who belongs to 3D graphics research group called 'MasterRenderer'
